##Problem Statement
The task is to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal dimensions. This classification aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the species of a flower with high accuracy based on given measurements.

##Introduction
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers, including four features—sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width—and a target variable indicating the species. This project involves analyzing the data, visualizing patterns, and building a classification model to predict the species of a flower.

##Abstract
This project explores the Iris dataset, preprocessing it for analysis and applying classification algorithms to predict the species. Techniques such as data visualization, feature selection, and machine learning are used to ensure a robust and interpretable model. The project demonstrates how simple machine learning models can provide accurate results in a structured classification problem.

##Conclusion
Using the Iris dataset, this project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning models in solving classification problems. After evaluating multiple algorithms, the results indicate that even with basic preprocessing, a classifier can achieve high accuracy in predicting the species of an iris flower. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automating such tasks in real-world applications.
